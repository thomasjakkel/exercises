# Notes for Refactoring

1. Initalize new node project and add typescript. Used es modules instead of commonjs.
2. Structured .json files to ts-objects with types
3. Added correct types to statement and refactored as arrow function
4. Moved formatter outside the function and divided result directly by 100
5. Used forEach loop and refactored calculations to a new function
